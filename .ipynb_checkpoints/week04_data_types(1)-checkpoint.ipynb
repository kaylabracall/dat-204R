    "Most of the time when you feed R a number it's going to assume you want a double. \n",
    "\n",
    "A note on naming: the book sometimes says \"numeric\" in the place of \"double.\" Either's fine. It's a difference between calling `typeof()` and `class()`. Also, while \"numeric\" doesn't mean anything outside of the context of R, the term \"double\" has a very formal and specific meaning that transcends specific programming languages. Let's talk about that:\n",

    "* 6.02 * 10^23\n",
    "* 1.616255 * 10^−35\n",
    "\n",
    "Yeah, well, we pretty much also do that in binary for numbers that *could be* very large or very small, and that representation is called \"floating point.\"\n",
    "* 1.1111... * 2^-1023 - smallest double \\[precision floating point number\\]\n",
    "* 1.1111... * 2^1023 - biggest double \\[precision floating point number\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Without digging into all the details, the parts you might actually care about go like this:\n",
    "* there's a bit that says \"this is a positive or negative number\"\n",
    "* there are 11 bits that are the exponent - up to 2^11 \n",
    "* there are 52 bits that specify the \"significand\" or \"mantissa\" - up to 2^52\n",
    "* there are both negative and positive zeros\n",
    "* there are both negative and positive infinities\n",
    "* there is more nuance that I have not explained here\n",
    "\n",
    "And most importantly:\n",
    "* there are rounding errors\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're doing financial calculations, you either need to use a library specifically for that, or you need to do all of your math in integers, dealing with dollars and cents separately. \n",
    "\n",
